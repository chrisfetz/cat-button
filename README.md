# cat-button
Android app where you push a button and get a random cat picture!

I'm making this app to practice:
* Test Driven Development with JUnit and Robolectric
* Interacting with the internet/pulling info from there
* Parsing JSON
* ~~Using AsyncTaskLoader~~ Using the Android Lifecycle Activity ViewModel Repository pattern to persist data
* Handling dynamicly sized images
* Displaying online images in an app
